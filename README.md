# Customer support project with Django

This is a project that helps user to specify his issue and report it to the Customer support. 
When the application is run, user is being redirected to the main page where user can enter his name, phone number, company name, email, to name his issue and to explain it. 
Thing that remained undone is an option to pick date and time intervals. That could be solved by using javascript to create date and time picker. 

As we are talking about the other side (admin), Django comes with the admin panel, where user can enter by clicking on this link: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/, and log in with the following credentials (user: admin pass: admin). 
When logged in, user has a record of every single issue that is being reported to the customer support.
